                We get three of us out there on the shore digging 
                    <a href="page5.html" style="color: white; text-decoration: none;">bunkers</a> into the sand. Working under moonshine and passing headlights of cars driving on state lands past curfew. Each one of us has our own dollar general cooler to carry nothing heavy not even liquids just milk and candy berries and the small engine parts that washed up from Inglewood.

                    You get working fast to get the little spark plugs and cam lobes out of the space zoned for bunker if you get J to make an orange julius with a couple eggs in it before you go out. He always cups one and take it upstairs for Cherie but keeps quiet about the eggs. We wouldn’t replace the orange juice concetrate just clean the blender.

                    The way to the shore hidden by fell cottonwoods cuts through a bulge in the creek and there’s no tip toeing across. I tried like Murry did by wadding over to the other side but he must’ve been dog paddling beneath the muddy waters. Got my shorts wet and all our tackle and poles full of water and algae. Getting up on the culvert is the better way and doesn’t take much longer except for waiting for the livestock trailers to clear the road. When we’re lucky it’s piglets and when not it’s shit.

                    I have the only shovel to bring and it’s as long as my forearm and as wide as my two hands together so Sam and J just use their two hands to hurl the sand out of the bunker. Anyway they can carry our styrofoam coolers. The lids rub against the walls of the cooler and squeak out a tune while we walk.
