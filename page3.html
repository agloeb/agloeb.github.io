                I once hit a 
                    <a href="page4.html" style="color: white; text-decoration: none;">pheasant</a> and did some damage.
                    Before that was another with buckshot stuck in its breast, still hard after the oven.But latley it’s been the pheasant above me wearing red feathers and ring to bed. Our turkey and prairie chicks wear their suits and jewels too but dress down for the night in woodland patterend pajamas. My pheasant walks on a razor and puts my brother to sleep in his bed touching the closet door and pocket door. It all helps hide the red LEDs and unmatched underwear. I’m in clover that you lay down the cakes in the early morning before everyone takes off their pajamas and puts their tiny faces on for valentines.
